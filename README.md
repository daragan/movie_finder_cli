# MovieFinderCli

Welcome to your new gem! In this directory, you'll find the files you need to be able to package up your Ruby library into a gem. Put your Ruby code in the file `lib/movie_finder_cli`. To experiment with that code, run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt.

TODO: Delete this and the text above, and describe your gem

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'movie_finder_cli'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install movie_finder_cli

## Usage

You are given a list of movies in which you can navigate through by pressing the corresponding number within the list. You are then given a small description of the film including the rating, genre, title, release year, synopsis and a link in which you can click to open in browser to find out more about the film. Once you have found the description to your liking or wish to look at other films, you can return to the list by submitting "Y" or "N" to exit out of the CLI application.

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
